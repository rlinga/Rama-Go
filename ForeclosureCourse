Pre-Foreclosure => Auction

=> Redemption Rights

1. Different for state to state and even county to county
2. You may not be able to see it before bidding
3. There is no compulsion that auction will tell about senior lender info. If there is a senior lender lien, they can ask for money even if the bid wins if senior lien is not cleared. Due diligence is required by going to court hosue and talking to title company
4. Auction types => Absolute, Reserve, Minimum Bid

5. Fee => Buyers Premium / Auction Service fee, Transfer fee
6. As long as what you bid is more than what you owe, you are good to proceed
7. If nobody buys at auction, it becomes REO / bank owned
